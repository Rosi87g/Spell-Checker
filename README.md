A Spell Checker program verifies the correctness of words within a given text by comparing them to a predefined dictionary. It identifies misspelled words and suggests corrections based on similarity using algorithms like Levenshtein distance or soundex. A Trie data structure can efficiently store and retrieve dictionary words, enhancing the program's speed and accuracy. This tool is widely used in text editing and processing applications.
